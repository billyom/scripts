# Heading 1
## Heading 2
Gotta leave a space after the #'s.

# Character Formatting

*Italic characters*  _Italic characters_
**bold characters** __bold characters__
~~strikethrough text~~

# Lists

* Item 1      # need space after *. + and - are also valid bullet markers
* Item 2
  * Item 2a   # two leading spaces to sub-item

Some say this works to autonumber ordered lists. 

1. First Item
* Second
  * 2a

# Code

Talk about `code` inline.

    A block of code
    is indented by 
    4 (no less) spaces.
    

```<language>
A block of code can also be marked with backticks. This method
supports the option of syntax highlighting the block as <language>.
```

# Links

Here is link reference - it should be invisible until referenced later:

[id]: star.png "Optional title attribute"

Now here is the reference

![Alt text][id]

Click on [link text](http://example.com/ ) here.

An immediate reference to an image:
