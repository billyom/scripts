can't get this to work

    (gdb) python
    import gdb
    class MallocBp(gdb.Breakpoint):
        def stop (self):
            gdb.write('MallocBp\n')
            return True  #True stop, False continue
    MallocBp('malloc')
    end
    Breakpoint 2 at 0x7fb946e710c0: malloc. (2 locations)
    (gdb)
    
        

Let's try:
https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/PythonGdbTutorial > Writing a new gdb command

    cat > /tmp/file << EOF
    import gdb
    class SavePrefixCommand (gdb.Command):
      "Prefix command for saving things."
    
      def __init__ (self):
        super (SavePrefixCommand, self).__init__ ("save",
                             gdb.COMMAND_SUPPORT,
                             gdb.COMPLETE_NONE, True)
    
    SavePrefixCommand()
    EOF
    
    (gdb) source /tmp/file               << older version may require 'source -p ...' 
    (gdb) help save
    Prefix command for saving things.
    
    List of save subcommands:
    
    
    Type "help save" followed by save subcommand name for full documentation.
    Type "apropos word" to search for commands related to "word".
    Command name abbreviations are allowed if unambiguous.
    (gdb)
    
ooh look we've made a 'prefix command' (whatever that is exactly)


Breakpoint to print caller name
    import gdb
    class MallocBp(gdb.Breakpoint):
        def stop (self):
            fr = gdb.newest_frame()
            print ("called from", fr.older().name())
            return True  #True stop, False continue
    MallocBp('xzalloc')

FinishBreakpoints
* These are *temporary* - seems you need to set them from another bp within the fn.
* Gives access to the return value of the fn (no matter where from the fn it returns afaik - but not cpp exception stack unwinding - calls self.out_of_scope()
